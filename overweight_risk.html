    <h2 class="und">What are the risks of being overweight?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Type 2 diabetes: </b>Type 2 diabetes occurs when your blood sugar is higher than normal. Over time, this can lead to other health issues, like heart disease, nerve damage, stroke, kidney disease, and vision problems.</li>
        <li><b>Heart disease: </b>People with obesity have higher than normal blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood sugar, all of which contribute to heart disease.</li>
        <li><b>Stroke: </b>Strokes occur when the blood supply to the brain is cut off. A stroke can cause damage to brain tissue and result in a range of disabilities, including speech and language impairment, weakened muscles, and changes to thinking and reasoning skills.</li>
        <li><b>Sleep apnea: </b>Sleep apnea is a disorder in which someone may momentarily stop breathing during sleep. People who are overweight and living with obesity are at a higher risk of having sleep apnea. This is because they tend to have more fat stored around the neck, making the airway shrink.</li>
        <li><b>High blood pressure: </b>Extra fat tissue in the body requires more oxygen and nutrients. Your blood vessels will need to circulate more blood to the extra fat tissue. This means your heart must work even harder to pump blood around the body. The increase in the amount of blood circulating puts extra pressure on the walls of your arteries. This added pressure is called high blood pressure, or hypertension. Over time, high blood pressure can damage your heart and arteries.</li>
        <li><b>Liver disease: </b>Fatty liver disease usually has no symptoms, but it can eventually lead to liver failure. The only way to reverse or manage the disease is to lose weight, exercise, and avoid drinking alcohol.</li>
        <li><b>Gallbladder disease: </b>People with obesity may have higher levels of cholesterol in their bile, or have large gallbladders that don’t work well, which can lead to gallstones. Gallstones can be painful and require surgery.</li>
        <li><b>Certain cancers: </b>obesity can increase your risk for certain cancers, including <i>breast, colon, gallbladder, pancreatic, kidney, and prostate cancer, as well as cancer of the uterus, cervix, endometrium, and ovaries.</i></li>
        <li><b>Pregnancy complications: </b>Pregnant women who are overweight or have obesity are more likely to develop insulin resistance, high blood sugar, and high blood pressure. This can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy and delivery, including: <i>gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, needing a cesarean delivery (C-section), blood clots,
            heavier bleeding than normal after delivery, premature birth, miscarriage, stillbirth, defects of the brain and spinal cord</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="und">Causes :</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Calories: </b>The average physically active man needs about <b>2,500</b> calories a day to maintain a healthy weight, and the average physically active woman needs about <b>2,000</b> calories a day.</li>
        <li><b>Diet: </b>Diet and lifestyle factors contribute to development of obesity and overweight. Some of the most common ones are: <i>eating large amounts of processed or fast food, drinking too much alcohol, eating out a lot, eating larger portions than you need, drinking too many sugary drinks, comfort eating</i></li>
        <li><b>Physical activity: </b>Lack of physical activity is another important factor related to obesity. Many people have jobs that involve sitting at a desk for most of the day. They also rely on their cars, rather than walking or cycling.</li>
        <li><b>Genetics: </b>In some people, genes can affect how their bodies change food into energy and store fat. Genes can also affect people's lifestyle choices.</li>
        <li><b>Medical reasons: </b><i>an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)</i> – where your thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones, <i>Cushing's syndrome</i> – a rare disorder that causes the over-production of steroid hormones</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="und">Prevention Measures :</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Drink Water: </b>Drinking more water acts as appetite suppressant; as a result you eat less.</li>
        <li><b>Go For a Walk: </b>A good walk for 30 minutes will benefit your heart and mind.</li>
        <li><b>Use Less Salt: </b>Use less salt in your diet and maintain a healthy blood pressure.</li>
        <li><b>Practice Yoga: </b>Practise various yoga asans for weight loss.</li>
        <li><b>Eat Green Vegetables: </b>Include green veggies in your diet, at least once a week.</li>
        <li><b>Eat Fruits: </b>Always carry apples and oranges to work. Eat fruits when cravings for snacks sets in.</li>
        <li><b>Avoid Saturated Fat Food: </b>Saturated fat increases cholesterol levels, which increases the risk of heart diseases and stroke.</li>
        <li><b>Avoid Sugar: </b>Stop eating sugary food, as sugar is the real villain for spreading the obesity epidemic.</li>
        <li><b>Never Skip Breakfast: </b>Skipping the first meal of the day will make you more hungry, which will give you fast food cravings.</li>
        <li><b>Exercise: </b>Take out at least 30 minutes from your busy schedule to exercise.</li>
    </ul>
