    <h2 class="und">What is healthy Body Mass Index(BMI) ?</h2>
    <ul>
        
    <li>Adult Body Mass Index is a range of body fat percentages that are determined by your age and height, notes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</li>
    <li>Typically, people with a BMI between 18.5 and 25 are considered at a healthy percentile.</li>
    <li>Those with a BMI lower than 18.5 are considered underweight, and those with a BMI between 25 and 30 are considered overweight.</li>
    <li>People with a BMI of 30 or higher are considered obese and at high risk for disease.</li>
    <li>While BMI measurements are standard for most people, there are occasional exceptions to the rule. For example, athletes and people with a higher level of muscle mass may generate a BMI calculation that designates them as overweight or even obese, despite their high level of fitness. It’s important for athletes to talk to their doctor to ensure they’re maintaining a healthy body fat balance.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="und">How to maintain healthy Body Mass Index(BMI) ?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Watch your portion sizes: </b>Eating smaller portions can help you to avoid eating too much food and allow you to include more of the foods you love into your daily life.</li>
        <li><b>Eat good foods: </b>Foods high in sugar and calories lead to weight gain if you are not careful. Choose foods that are high in nutrition and taste, like fruits, vegetables and whole grains.</li>
        <li><b>Drink more water: </b>Drinking water, along with eating good foods and exercising daily, can help you to maintain a healthy weight.</li>
        <li><b>Track what you eat: </b>Many people are unaware of exactly how many calories they consume, which is why it’s important to track and monitor the total calories you eat and drink each day. If you want to lose weight, you must burn more calories than you eat or drink. </li>
        <li><b>Exercise daily: </b>Your body weight is affected by the amount of energy you take in and the amount you use. If you want to maintain your current body weight, you will need to use as much energy as you consume; to lose weight, you need to use more energy than you consume. Find a good exercise program that includes both cardio and strength training. </li>
        <li><b>Get more sleep: </b>Getting a good amount of sleep every night helps to reset your body, preparing it for the next day. According to the National Institutes of Health, those who don’t get enough sleep often tend to eat more food than they need as a way to stay awake. Make time every day to get enough sleep.</li>
    </ul>
