        the three trimesters</h1>

    <p>Pregnancy has three trimesters, each of which is marked by specific fetal developments. A pregnancy is considered full-term at 40 weeks; infants 
        delivered before the end of week 37 are considered premature. Premature infants may have problems with their growth and development, 
        as well as difficulties in breathing and digesting.</p>
    <h2 class="und">Overview:</h2>
    <p>
        A full-term pregnancy has three trimesters and lasts around 40 weeks — starting from the first day of the last menstrual period. 
        In each trimester, the fetus meets specific developmental milestones.
        <br><br>
        While 40 weeks is the usual time frame, a full-term baby can be born as early as 37 weeks and as late as 42 weeks<br><br>
        The Office on Women’s HealthTrusted Source defines the three trimesters as follows, though the timing can vary:
    </p>
   
    <ul>
        <li>first trimester: 1–12 weeks</li>
        <li>second trimester: 13–28 weeks</li>
        <li>third trimester: 29–40 weeks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some people also talk about a fourth trimester, which is the 3-month transitional period after delivery.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 70%;height: 50%;" src="images/IMG_20230313_220034.jpg"></p>
    
    <h2 class="und">First Trimester (0 to 12 Weeks):</h2><br>
    
    <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 70%;height: 50%;" src="images/1.png"></p> <br>
    <p>The first trimester is the most crucial to your baby's development. During this period, your baby's body structure and organ systems 
        develop. Most miscarriages and birth defects occur during this period.</p>
    <p>Your body also undergoes major changes during the first trimester. These changes often cause a variety of symptoms, including nausea, 
        fatigue, breast tenderness and frequent urination. Although these are common pregnancy symptoms, every woman has a different 
        experience. For example, while some may experience an increased energy level during this period, others may feel very tired and 
        emotional.</p>
    <h3>The fetus</h3>
    <p>At conception, the egg and sperm combine to form a zygote, which implants in the wall of the uterus. The zygote becomes an embryo as its cells divide and grow.<br>
    <br>By the end of the first 12 weeks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All the body’s major organs and structures have begun to develop.</li>
       <li>The heart is beating regularly.</li>
       <li>Fingers and toes have formed.</li>
       <li>The fetus is around 3 inches (in) long and weighs nearly 1 ounce.</li>
    <li>The nerves and muscles work together, and the fetus can make a fist.</li>
    <li>The eyelids have formed and will remain closed until around week 28, to protect the eyes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The pregnant person</h3>
    <p>A person also experiences many changes during their first trimester of pregnancy.<br><br>
    These includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>fatigue</li>
       <li>tender, swollen breasts</li>
       <li>mood changes</li>
       <li>cravings for certain foods</li>
    <li>headaches</li>
    <li>indigestion</li>
    <li>a need to urinate more often</li>
    <li>weight changes</li>
    <li>constipation</li>
    <li>nausea, sometimes with vomiting, known as morning sickness</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="und">Second Trimester (13 to 28 Weeks):</h2><br>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 80%;height: 60%;" src="images/2.png"></p>
    <p><br>The second trimester of pregnancy is often called the "golden period" because many of the unpleasant effects of early pregnancy disappear. During the second trimester, you're likely to experience decreased nausea, better sleep patterns and an increased energy level. However, you may experience a whole new set of symptoms, such as back pain, abdominal pain, leg cramps, constipation and heartburn.
        <br><br>Somewhere between 16 weeks and 20 weeks, you may feel your baby's first fluttering movements.
    </p>
    <h3>The fetus</h3>
    <p>By the end of the second trimester, the following will have happened:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Meconium, the first bowel movement, has developed in the intestines.</li>
       <li>The fetus can see, hear, make a sucking motion, and scratch itself.</li>
       <li>Skin, hair, and nails have formed.</li>
       <li>The lungs have formed but do not yet work.</li>
    <li>The fetus is sleeping and waking regularly.</li>
    <li>A male’s testicles will have moved to the scrotum, and a female’s eggs will have formed in the ovaries.</li>
    <li>Taste buds have formed.</li>
    <li>Bone marrow is making blood cells.</li>
    <li>Lanugo, which is fine hair, covers the body.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The pregnant person</h3>
    <p>Many people feel more comfortable during the second trimester of pregnancy. Morning sickness and fatigue often reduce or disappear.
        <br><br>Meanwhile, new changes take place:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The abdomen expands as the fetus grows.</li>
       <li>Stretch marks may appear on the abdomen, thighs, breasts, and buttocks.</li>
       <li>The areola, the skin around the nipples, becomes darker.</li>
       <li>The skin on the face and may darken in patches.</li>
    <li>The ankles, fingers, and face may swell.</li>
    <li>Itching may occur. If it happens with vomiting or yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, known as jaundice, seek medical advice.</li>
    
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="und">Third Trimester (29 to 40 Weeks):</h2><br>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 70%;height: 50%;" src="images/3.png"></p><br>
    <p>You have now reached your final stretch of pregnancy and are probably very excited and anxious for the birth of your baby. Some of the physical symptoms you may experience during this period include shortness of breath, hemorrhoids, urinary incontinence, varicose veins and sleeping problems. Many of these symptoms arise from the increase in the size of your uterus, which expands from approximately 2 ounces before pregnancy to 2.5 pounds at the time of birth.
    </p>
    <h3>The fetus</h3>
    <p>Most organs and body systems have formed by now, and they will continue to grow and mature.
        <br><br>During this trimester:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The bones are hardening.</li>
       <li>Movements become more noticeable.</li>
       <li>The eyes are open and can sense light.</li>
       <li>The lungs have formed but do not yet work.</li>
    <li>Lanugo falls away, and a waxy coating, called vernix, develops.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Toward delivery, the fetus drops lower in the person’s abdomen and usually turns head-down.</p>
    <h3>The pregnant person</h3>
    <p>The growth of the fetus can cause new discomfort at this time.
        <br><br>A person might also experience:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>heartburn</li>
       <li>shortness of breath</li>
       <li>swelling in the ankles, face, and fingers</li>
       <li>insomnia</li>
    <li>mood changes</li>
    <li>leakage of milk from the breasts</li>
    <li>other breast and nipple changes</li>
    <li>frequent urination</li>
    <li>hemorrhoids</li>
    <li>Braxton-Hicks contractions, which do not indicate labor</li>
    <li>real contractions, which indicate labor</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is also normal to feel anxiety about the delivery and parenthood toward the end of a pregnancy.</p>
    
    <h2 class="und">The fourth trimester: Postpartum</h2><br>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 40%;height: 40%;" src="images/4.webp"></p><br>
    <p>The 3 months after delivery play a key role in the health of the person and their baby. Some people call this transitional period a fourth trimester.
        <br><br>While this can be an exciting time, the range of hormonal and environmental changes can pose challenges.
        <br><br>These challenges might involveTrusted Source:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>recovering after delivery, especially if there are stitches</li>
        <li>dealing with lochia, a discharge of blood and tissue, which may continue for several weeks</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- <ul>
        <li><b>Stop smoking.</b> If you smoke, quit. If you don't smoke, don't start. Smoking is linked to several types of cancer — not just lung cancer. Stopping now will reduce your risk of cancer in the future.</li>
        <li><b>Avoid excessive sun exposure.</b> Harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun can increase your risk of skin cancer. Limit your sun exposure by staying in the shade, wearing protective clothing or applying sunscreen.</li>
        <li><b>Eat a healthy diet.</b> Choose a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Select whole grains and lean proteins. Limit your intake of processed meats.</li>
        <li><b>Exercise most days of the week.</b> Regular exercise is linked to a lower risk of cancer. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week. If you haven't been exercising regularly, start out slowly and work your way up to 30 minutes or longer.</li>
        <li><b>Maintain a healthy weight.</b> Being overweight or obese may increase your risk of cancer. Work to achieve and maintain a healthy weight through a combination of a healthy diet and regular exercise.</li>
        <li><b>Drink alcohol in moderation, if you choose to drink.</b> If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.</li>
        <li><b>Schedule cancer screening exams.</b> Talk to your doctor about what types of cancer screening exams are best for you based on your risk factors.</li>
        <li><b>Ask your doctor about immunizations.</b> Certain viruses increase your risk of cancer. Immunizations may help prevent those viruses, including hepatitis B, which increases the risk of liver cancer, and human papillomavirus (HPV), which increases the risk of cervical cancer and other cancers. Ask your doctor whether immunization against these viruses is appropriate for you.</li>
