Background:
Implementation of guidelines for evidence-based screening and disease prevention remains a core challenge in health care. The lack of access to accurate and personalized health recommendations may contribute to sub-optimal performance of medical screening, and ultimately increased risk for communicable and non-communicable disease. Many women do not monitor their cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk or receive regular medical screenings. A health recommendation tool (HeaRT) that provides women with profiled, individually tailored information about recommended tests and screening was designed to improve women's engagement in preventive health. This study characterized utilization of the tool in a real world setting.

Objective: 
To describe the development and usage patterns of HeaRT, a novel health web-tool that provides personalized health recommendations for women.

A user-friendly web tool that provides personalized, gender-specific health recommendations may facilitate increased risk factor assessments and screenings in women, reducing the risk of communicable and non-communicable disease.

Methods:
Extracted web-tool data including user input (age, BMI, smoking status and family history of CVD) and time spent in the results screen were analysed. Engagement was assessed by time spent in each results category, number of clicks and whether the user emailed/printed the recommendations. Usage patterns were analysed using multivariate analyses, logistic regression and cluster analyses.
